# Overview

This is a simple snake game written in C++ to demonstrate how we can manipulate objects and classes in C++..

My purpose for designing this software was to review and learn a bit more about C++ especially with a simple game format. Not just your basic functions but a looped user interface that takes user inputs. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my IDE for this project.

I used C++ of course with the graphics library and the stdlib and stdio libraries as well. Also a simple time.h file in order for us to be able to keep track of time while in the loop.

# Future Work

* Update header files in github repository (was developed in IDE where the files are integrated rather than in source file)
* Create a menu with advanced options
* Different game types (ie. Speed changer etc)
